# Project Description
An analysis of historical NCAA Basketball Tournamnets (1985-2016) based upon team and seeding.

# Research Questions to Answer
- How does each tournament seed (1-16) typically perform and are there teams that outperform their expection?
- Which games can we expect to be interesting? (Close results, high-seeds, overtime games, nearby seeds)
- What games are most discussed on Twitter? Do those match what we indicated as exciting games?
